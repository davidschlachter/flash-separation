# flash-separation
Flash separation simulator

Simulator for flash distillation. Download the project, and open the 'flash-separation.drjava' file using 'Project' > 'Open...' in Dr Java. Compile the project, and press 'Run Project' to start the simulation!

Note also that several test cases have been included. These are the classes starting with 'Test_', and their methods starting with 'test' are run when you press the 'Test Project' button in the Dr. Java menu bar. If all the tests pass (i.e. assertTrue boolean statements return `true`), then all the tests will appear in green in the 'Test Output' tab. These tests cover various validation examples and are not required in ordinary use of the simulator.
